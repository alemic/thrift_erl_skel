Makes simple thrift skeleton server based on a template.

For instance if you have a file foo.thrift with the following contents

service Foo {
  void bar (1: i32 baz)
}

Then run

% git clone git://github.com/djnym/thrift_erl_skel.git
% thrift_erl_skel/make_new_thrift.pl foo foo.thrift 9999
% cd foo
% edit src/foo_service.erl

add bar/1 to export
add the following at the end of the file

bar (I) ->
  io:format ("bar (~p)~n",[I]).

% rebar compile
% ./start_foo.sh

Creating a client to talk to the server is left as an exercise for the reader.
